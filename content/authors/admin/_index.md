I am a final-year undergraduate student in Mathematics and Computer Science at [LMU Munich](https://lmu.de/en/). There, I am a research assistant at [Prof. Gitta Kutyniok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitta_Kutyniok)'s chair on "Mathematical Foundations of AI" and assist with the coordination of the DFG-funded priority program ["Theoretical Foundations of Deep Learning"](https://www.dfg.de/foerderung/info_wissenschaft/2020/info_wissenschaft_20_36/index.html). Moreover,  at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) I am advised by [Prof. Song Mei](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~songmei/) and I am conducting research with [Prof. Bruno Olshausen](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/baolshausen.html) from the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/) through [Machine Learning at Berkeley](https://ml.berkeley.edu/).

Next summer, I will be a quantitative trading intern at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) and for the past 2 years I have been working as a part-time software engineer at the startup [Fulfin](https://www.fulfin.com/eng/).
