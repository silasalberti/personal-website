I am a PhD student in machine learning at [Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/~salberti).
I am co-advised by [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/) and [Chris RÃ©](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/) and I am broadly interested in foundation models and theory. I am affiliated with [Stanford AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/) and [Center for Research on Foundation Models](https://crfm.stanford.edu/).
My undergrad was in Mathematics at [LMU Munich](https://lmu.de/en/), where I was a research assistant at [Prof. Gitta Kutyniok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitta_Kutyniok)'s chair for Mathematical Foundations of AI and helped coordinate the DFG-funded priority program ["Theoretical Foundations of Deep Learning"](https://www.dfg.de/foerderung/info_wissenschaft/2020/info_wissenschaft_20_36/index.html). 
Moreover,  at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) I was advised by [Prof. Song Mei](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~songmei/) and conducted research with [Prof. Bruno Olshausen](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/baolshausen.html) from the [Redwood Center](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/) through [Machine Learning at Berkeley](https://ml.berkeley.edu/).

Last summer, I was a quantitative trading intern at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) and before that for 2 years I was working as a part-time software engineer at the startup [Fulfin](https://www.fulfin.com/en/). Currently building [Cofactory](https://cofactory.ai) which is part of [AI Grant](https://aigrant.com). Moreover, I'm a student researcher at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/).
